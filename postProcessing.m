% Script postProcessing.m processes the raw signal from the specified data
% file (in settings) operating on blocks of 37 seconds of data.
%
% First it runs acquisition code identifying the satellites in the file,
% then the code and carrier for each of the satellites are tracked, storing
% the 1msec accumulations.  After processing all satellites in the 37 sec
% data block, then postNavigation is called. It calculates pseudoranges
% and attempts a position solutions. At the end plots are made for that
% block of data.

%                         THE SCRIPT "RECIPE"
%
% The purpose of this script is to combine all parts of the software
% receiver.
%
% 1.1) Open the data file for the processing and seek to desired point.
%
% 2.1) Acquire satellites
%
% 3.1) Initialize channels (preRun.m).
% 3.2) Pass the channel structure and the file identifier to the tracking
% function. It will read and process the data. The tracking results are
% stored in the trackResults structure. The results can be accessed this
% way (the results are stored each millisecond):
% trackResults(channelNumber).XXX(fromMillisecond : toMillisecond), where
% XXX is a field name of the result (e.g. I_P, codePhase etc.)
%
% 4) Pass tracking results to the navigation solution function. It will
% decode navigation messages, find satellite positions, measure
% pseudoranges and find receiver position.
%
% 5) Plot the results.
